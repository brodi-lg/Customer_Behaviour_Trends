##This is a mock presentation on customer behaviour analysis based on the following dataset sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset. The data was sourced from several GitHub repositories and Kaggle datasets totalling to 3900 entries. The exact year for this data set is unknown. As such, its year and company details are unknown. For the purposes of this presentation, this data now belongs to a fictional enterprise called the Santa Shop, USA.The company has hired a data analyst to review their year’s sales and provide insights and feedback.

###**Objectives**
 This project aims to analyze customer data to uncover patterns and insights that can drive business decisions. The objectives include:

	2	Analyzing purchasing behavior and trends.
	3	Identifying key factors influencing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
	4	Developing actionable recommendations for improving customer engagement and revenue growth.
 
###**Key Features**
	•	Analysis of categorical variables including:
	◦	Gender
	◦	Category
	◦	Season
	◦	Discount Applied
	◦	Promo Code Used
	◦	Frequency of Purchases
	◦	Region
	•	Analysis of numerical variables:

  As a result, no valuable insights could be retrieved from correlations and hypothesis testing.

###**Libraries Used**
The following Python libraries were utilized for data analysis and visualization:
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
	•	NumPy: Numerical computations.
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
	•	Statsmodels: Statistical analysis.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for developing and presenting the analysis.
